## 🎯 Overview

Frame-level speech recognition operates on individual audio frames rather than entire utterances, enabling more precise temporal alignment and improved recognition of continuous speech. This approach is particularly beneficial for:

- Real-time speech recognition applications
- Phoneme-level analysis and alignment
- Voice activity detection
- Speech enhancement preprocessing

## ✨ Features

- **Frame-by-Frame Processing**: Analyzes audio signals at the frame level for precise temporal resolution
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Built using modern PyTorch framework for flexibility and performance
- **Deep Neural Networks**: Utilizes state-of-the-art neural architectures for speech recognition
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Comprehensive audio preprocessing including feature extraction
- **Training Framework**: Complete training pipeline with validation and testing
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Multiple evaluation metrics for comprehensive performance analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Audio Preprocessing**: 
   - Windowing and framing
   - Feature extraction (MFCC, spectrograms, etc.)
   - Normalization and augmentation

2. **Neural Network Model**:
   - Input layer for audio features
   - Hidden layers (LSTM/GRU/CNN based)
   - Output layer for classification

3. **Post-processing**:
   - Frame-level predictions
   - Temporal smoothing
   - Sequence alignment
